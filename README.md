# nightlightDiscovery
developing an interactive notebook for game design

## First Steps

Nightlight Discovery is a game my 9 year-old daughter and I are developing with Unity. Before we dive into the depths of Unity, though, we are going to plan out the game. 

Nightlight Disccovery is a game, but it's also a path that guides you in crafting a story and prompts you with actionable steps in the creative process of designing and coding the game. Interwoven throughout the process are learning targets pulled from the Common Core curriculum. 

Nighlight Discovery is learning about language, math, and science through designing a game set in a forest populated by animals. The charming, wild creatures serve as our guide.

In the darkness of our rooms, by the light of our screens, we'll learn responsibility for our planet and all lifeforms on earth. 

Nightlight Discovery is a work created in public. Join the journey through our newsletter.
